# Repetier-Server-Telegram-Bot (Beta)
Telegram Bot connecting your Repetier Server and your Telegram bot account.

It updates every 2 seconds your bot and you´ll have latest information about your prints and printer status.

This is still a beta version and i am testing it with several friends having up to 2 printers connected to a raspberry.

Application is tested on Windows 10 and Linux Mint 20

Following requierements:

Python >= 3.8 

# Library dependencies (installable via pip):

- pip install arrow
- pip install websocket_client
- pip install requests
- pip install imageio
- pip install pygifsicle
- pip install opencv-python
- pip install python-telegram-bot

# Available Languages:

German, English, Spanish
Please be aware of differences in the platform (Windows and Linux).

You can reduce the program size by deleting languages in the folder ./locale (But i would not recommend it, there are still only 3 languages inside...a few kB of your HD)

# Additional information & support request

i would appreciate if someone would support me to add languages. I would be fully supportive with it, because i´ve a translation tool available. 
Please get in contact with me.

I am not a programming specialist, I know the code is looking maybe terrible for some persons which do program frequently.
The software itself is stable. I would be happy if someone with better programming skills would support me with dividing the main program to separated files (Bot, Connection to Server, etc.). I was not able to program it (Every program gets somehow better, but i am far away of declaring myself professional). 

I am also new to Github. It´s my first program which i made available. So please, i am open to learn. Let me know, if there is something to improve.

I have a job. I do this in my free time. So, please, i´ll answer usually <24h. I am located in europe, so don´t expect wonders, if i am sleeping, lol.

Disclaimer: It´s free, it´s in my eyes a missing feature for persons which used before Octoprint and miss the telegram bot option
